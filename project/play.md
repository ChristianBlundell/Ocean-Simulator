# Play with the ocean simulator

## Build relationships with the animals

* Explore the reef
* Follow schools & pods
* Play games with the dolphins
* Sing with the whales
* Gain their trust

## See the animals and feel their man-made problems

*(Man-made problems don’t appear at the start, and you can go deeper out into the ocean where humans haven’t really caused problems)*

* Turtles swim with trash bags on them
* Dolphin gets caught in a net suddenly
* Polluted water/reef with algae bloom
* Animals looking for food
* The life of a fish (or clam, crab, or snail)

## Help fix the animals’ man-made problems

* Pick up trash
* Set them free from nets

## Help improve the animals’ life

* Keep a look out for sharks
* ~~Plan migration routes (where a migration route be a problem?) This wouldn’t be a swimming-in-the-ocean experience.~~
* Study ecology

## Welcome others to the ocean

* Aqua farmers looking to grow underwater
* Tourists who want to see/play with the specific animals
* Animals coming on migration journeys
