Debugging notes

When wrist was kinematic, the hand wouldn't be placed correctly
when there was a hinge joint and the wrist was mirrored. When the
wrist was dynamic, though, the hand ended up being placed correctly.

Now armsLR() is working. I hope the rest of the player can be working soon.
I'm not sure when or why the regular / special layout choices need to be made,
but it's working now that they're easy to switch between.
